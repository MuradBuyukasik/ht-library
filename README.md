# The High Thumos Library

This is an ongoing project for the [High Thumos](https://gotthumos.com/) Discord group.

In Discord we have a "book of the month" which we read as a community. The aim for this project is to provide a centralized hub exclusive for Discord members to create and store notes on the books they read in an organized manner, so that they can be easily accessed for future reference or to prepare material for discussion in voice chat.
